                <h2>Cube Runner: A VBA Game Project</h2>
                <p>6/8/2023</p>
                <p>During my early stages of learning programming, I took on a side project called Cube Runner to further develop my VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) skills. Cube Runner is a game created using VBA and user forms within Microsoft Excel. While it may not boast the complexity of professional games, it served as an excellent opportunity for me to apply my knowledge and showcase my progress. Let's explore the details of this project.</p>
                <p></p><a href="/src/images/demos/QubeRunner_Demo.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/src/images/demos/QubeRunner_Demo.gif" alt="Cube Runner Game Demo" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"></a></p>
                <h3>The Game Concept</h3>
                <p>Cube Runner introduces a simple and engaging gameplay concept. Players control a cube-shaped character with the objective of collecting cubes that spawn at random intervals in various locations on the screen. However, caution is required as enemy blue boxes also appear, and touching them results in a game over. The game offers endless progression, allowing players to challenge themselves and improve their skills.</p>
                <h3>Showcasing VBA Skills</h3>
                <p>Cube Runner represents a significant milestone in my programming journey, emphasizing my focus on VBA development and expanding my capabilities. This project allowed me to showcase the following skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VBA Proficiency:</strong> Cube Runner demonstrates my ability to leverage VBA to create interactive experiences within the Microsoft Excel environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Developing Cube Runner required solving challenges such as implementing random cube spawning and managing game logic, enhancing my problem-solving abilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Accessing the Project</h3>
                <p>If you're interested in exploring Cube Runner or reviewing the source code, you can access the project on my GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/AlecBrooks/QubeRunner">Cube Runner on GitHub</a>. Simply clone the repository and follow the provided instructions to run the game within Microsoft Excel.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Cube Runner served as a valuable project during my early programming journey, allowing me to apply my VBA skills and showcase my progress. While it may not compare to commercial games in complexity, it represents my dedication to continuous learning and improvement.
