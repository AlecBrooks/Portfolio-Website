Cube Runner is a game created using VBA and user forms within Microsoft Excel. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge, challenge myself, and showcase my progress. Here is an overview of the project.</span></p><p><a href="/src/images/demos/QubeRunner_Demo.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="/src/images/demos/QubeRunner_Demo.gif" alt="Cube Runner Game Demo" loading="lazy"></a></p><h3 id="The-Game-Concept" data-id="The-Game-Concept"><span>The Game Concept</span></h3><p><span>Cube Runner introduces a simple gameplay concept. Players control a pink “cubeMan” character with the objective of collecting cubes that spawn at random intervals in various locations on the screen. Additionally, there are enemy blue boxes that chase the player, and prolonged contact with them will result in a game over. The game offers endless level progression, allowing players to play for the highscore indefinitely.</span></p><h3 id="Experience" data-id="Experience"><span>Experience</span></h3><p><span>Cube Runner represents a significant milestone in my programming journey, emphasizing my focus on VBA development and expanding my capabilities. This project allowed me to test both my VBA Proficiency and Problem Solving. (because, oh boy! there were problems.)</span></p><h3 id="Accessing-the-Project" data-id="Accessing-the-Project"><span>Accessing the Project</span></h3><p><span>If you’re interested in exploring Cube Runner or reviewing the source code, you can access the project on my GitHub repository: </span><a href="https://github.com/AlecBrooks/QubeRunner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Cube Runner on GitHub</span></a><span>. Simply download the repository and follow the provided instructions to run the game within Microsoft Excel.</span></p><h3 id="Conclusion" data-id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h3><p><span>Cube Runner served as a valuable project during my early VBA journey, allowing me to apply the VBA skills I learned and test my progress. While it may not be a particularly complex game, it represents a milestone in my programming journey. Feel free to visit the GitHub repository and experience Cube Runner firsthand!</span></p></div>
